# Off-the-Beaten-Path Travel Recommender

## Overview

This project implements a context-aware travel recommendation system designed to surface "off-the-beaten-path" destinations. Unlike traditional recommendation engines that favor popular tourist spots, our system identifies hidden gems by analyzing travel blogs, structured attributes, and popularity signals to recommend lesser-known destinations that match user interests.

The application combines:
- **BM25 Baseline Search**: Traditional information retrieval over a corpus of travel blogs
- **ModernBERT Search Model**: Semantic retrieval and re-ranking using transformer-based text embeddings from blog content, enabling contextual understanding beyond keyword matching

All components are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy deployment and reproducibility.

## Project Components

### BM25 Baseline Search
BM25 (Best Match 25) is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. Our implementation:

**How It Works:**
- Loads ~XX,XXX travel blog posts from PostgreSQL database
- Tokenizes and indexes content using `rank-bm25`
- Returns top-k most relevant destinations based on query terms
- Provides blog metadata (title, author, URL) for each result

**Features:**
- Full-text search over blog titles, descriptions, and content
- Fast in-memory indexing (loaded once at startup)
- Returns destination names, coordinates, and content previews

### ModernBERT Semantic Search Model

A transformer-based semantic retrieval and re-ranking model that captures the meaning of user queries and travel narratives, enabling discovery of destinations that align with “off-the-beaten-path” intent beyond surface-level keyword overlap.

**How it Works**

- Encodes blog content and user queries using ModernBERT transformer embeddings
- Projects both into a shared semantic vector space
- Computes similarity scores to retrieve and re-rank destinations based on contextual relevance
- Combines semantic similarity with lightweight metadata filters (e.g., geography, experience type)

**Model Capabilities:**

- Understands experiential intent (e.g., quiet, local, remote, authentic) from natural language
- Captures contextual cues implicitly through embeddings rather than hand-crafted rules
- Handles synonymy and paraphrasing (e.g., “hidden village” ≈ “undiscovered town”)
- Robust to sparse or ambiguous queries

**Outputs:**

- Ranked list of destinations with semantic relevance scores
- Associated blog metadata (title, author, URL, excerpts)
- Destination coordinates for downstream visualization

### Architecture

The application consists of two Docker containers:

**Frontend (Streamlit)**
- Port: 8501
- Framework: Streamlit
- Purpose: Interactive web UI for search and visualization

**API Layer (FastAPI)**
- Port: 8000 (mapped to 8081 on host)
- Framework: FastAPI
- Purpose: Serves BM25 and ModernBERT models via REST API

**Database**
- PostgreSQL database containing travel blog corpus
- Connected via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Stores: blog posts, locations, coordinates, metadata

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have:

**Docker Desktop** (Windows/Mac) or **Docker Engine** (Linux)
- Version 20.10 or higher
- Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

**Docker Compose**
- Version 2.0 or higher
- Included with Docker Desktop
- For Linux: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Check Docker Compose version
docker-compose --version

# Verify Docker is running
docker ps
```

## Docker Deployment Instructions

### Building and Starting Containers

**1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/dsan6700_app_dev_project.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd dsan6700_app_dev_project
```

**2. Set Up Environment Variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your database connection:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

**3. Build and Start All Services:**
```bash
# Build images and start containers
docker-compose up --build

# OR run in detached mode (background)
docker-compose up --build -d
```

**What This Does:**
- Builds the API container from `backend/Dockerfile.api`
- Builds the Streamlit container from `frontend/Dockerfile.streamlit`
- Creates a Docker network for inter-container communication
- Starts both services with proper dependency ordering
- Mounts source directories for hot-reloading during development

**4. Wait for Services to Initialize:**

The first BM25 search will load ~XX,XXX blog posts from the database and build the index. This takes approximately 30-60 seconds.

### Accessing the Applications

**Stop Containers (Preserves Data):**
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop specific service
docker-compose stop api
```

**Complete Cleanup (Remove Everything):**
```bash
# Stop containers and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v

# Remove all unused Docker resources
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

**Restart Services:**
```bash
# Restart all services
docker-compose restart

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart api
```

## Using the Travel Recommender

### Step 1: Access the Web Interface
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501

### Step 2: Select Search Model
Choose between:
- **BM25**: Traditional keyword-based search over blog corpus
- **Attribute+Context (Recommended)**: Custom ranking with popularity dampening
- **TF-IDF**: Alternative keyword-based approach

### Step 3: Configure Search Parameters

**Query:**
- Enter free-form text: "small coastal towns with artisan markets"
- Describe the type of destination you're looking for

**Filters:**
- **Activity Types**: skiing, hiking, museums, camping, diving, etc.
- **Geographic Type**: coastal, mountain, island, urban, desert, etc.
- **Results (k)**: Number of destinations to return (3-50)

### Step 4: View Results

The application returns:

**Results Tab:**
- Ranked list of destinations with scores and confidence
- Destination name and country
- Tags (geographic, cultural, experience)
- Snippets from relevant blog posts
- Context cues (positive/negative indicators)
- Scoring breakdown

**Maps Tab:**
- Interactive global map with destination markers
- Color-coded by relevance score
- Click markers for details

**Diagnostics Tab:**
- Model parameters used
- Weight distributions
- Filter settings
